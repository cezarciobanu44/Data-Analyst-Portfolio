## 🏗️SQL data cleaning and preparation

I used SQL queries to clean and prepare the data by filtering incomplete records, correcting data types, and standardizing column names. Key steps included removing duplicates, handling missing sales and cost values, and aggregating detailed transactions into summary metrics. These preparations ensured accurate, consistent data that formed a reliable foundation for my Power BI analysis.
