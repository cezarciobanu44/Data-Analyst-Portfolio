# üßπ SQL Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning, preparation, and analysis using SQL Server and the AdventureWorks 2019 database. The focus is on transforming raw sales data into analysis-ready datasets through systematic data quality improvements and progressive analytical inquiry.

## üìã Project Objectives

- **Data Quality Assurance**: Implement robust data cleaning procedures
- **Progressive Analysis**: Move from general overview to specific insights
- **Business Storytelling**: Structure analysis to tell compelling business stories
- **Analytical Foundation**: Prepare clean, reliable data for downstream BI tools

## üîç Analytical Approach

### Step-by-Step Methodology

1. **Data Gathering & Initial Assessment**
   - Identified key tables and relationships
   - Assessed data quality and completeness
   - Documented business rules and assumptions

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values and null entries
   - Standardized data formats and types
   - Validated data integrity through joins

3. **Progressive Analysis Framework**
   - General: Total sales overview
   - Specific: Sales by region, period, customer segment, product
   - Detailed: Relationship analysis between dimensions

## üíæ Key SQL Components

### Core Query Structure
```sql
SELECT
    st.Name AS TerritoryName,
    YEAR(soh.OrderDate) AS SalesYear,
    SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT soh.SalesOrderID) AS OrdersCount
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader soh
INNER JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory st ON soh.TerritoryID = st.TerritoryID
WHERE soh.OrderDate IS NOT NULL
    AND soh.TotalDue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY st.Name, YEAR(soh.OrderDate)
ORDER BY SalesYear DESC, TotalSales DESC;
```

### Data Quality Measures Implemented

1. **Null Value Handling**
   - Filtered out records with missing order dates
   - Excluded transactions with null total amounts
   - Ensured referential integrity through inner joins

2. **Data Type Optimization**
   - Converted dates to meaningful time granularities (year, quarter, month)
   - Standardized currency and numeric formats
   - Consistent territory and customer classifications

3. **Referential Integrity**
   - Used INNER JOINs to maintain only valid territory assignments
   - Verified customer-order relationships
   - Ensured product-sales linkages

## üìä Analysis Categories

### 1. Temporal Analysis
- **Total sales by year**: Year-over-year growth patterns
- **Seasonal trends**: Quarterly and monthly performance variations
- **Period identification**: Peak and low-performance timeframes

### 2. Regional Analysis
- **Territory performance**: Sales distribution across geographic regions
- **Regional comparison**: Identifying top and bottom performing areas
- **Market penetration**: Understanding regional market dynamics

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- **Purchase behavior**: Customer ordering patterns and frequency
- **Value analysis**: High-value vs. regular customers
- **Retention insights**: Customer loyalty indicators

### 4. Product Performance
- **Category analysis**: Sales performance by product categories
- **Product mix**: Best and worst performing products
- **Cross-selling opportunities**: Product relationship analysis

## üéØ Business Questions Answered

1. **What are our total sales and order volumes by year?**
2. **Which regions generate the highest and lowest sales?**
3. **What are our seasonal sales patterns?**
4. **How do different customer segments contribute to revenue?**
5. **Which products drive the most value?**
6. **What relationships exist between region, customer, and product performance?**
