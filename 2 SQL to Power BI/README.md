## ðŸŒ“SQL to Power BI
I designed a star schema to organize sales, product, customer, and time data into fact and dimension tables, enabling efficient analysis. SQL queries were key in extracting and aggregating data to build metrics like sales, profit, and order values. This structure and querying ensured fast, accurate reporting and flexible slicing of business insights in Power BI.
